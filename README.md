# Keras-Sentiment-Prediction-IMDB-Movie-Reviews

 For this project, we will be predicting the sentiment of movie reviews whether they are positive or negative. We will be using the IMDB movie reviews dataset that is conveniently available that is built in into the Keras package. We will also be using LSTM's to read the reviews and make a prediction.

>to be the next best thing since x files but as always nothing will ever take down that show in my opinion i am telling you it's scary and then suspenseful and then mellow towards the end you have miles as a love puppy with a weird pet that is a new species you have two people on the run from authorities and a killer tsunami about to strike wow and did i mention miles pet is a potential killer well the rest of his species is surface is a brilliant show with spins and twists that delivers it all



### Sample 2

**PREDICTION: 0.03893274% Positive**

**ACTUAL: Negative**

>you actually want to die however delivers considerably more br br rather than focus on bare flesh and gore though there is a little of each no sex however the flick focuses on delivering impending dread mounting tension amidst a lovely scenic backdrop these feelings are further heightened by a cast of realistically likable characters and antagonists that are more amoral than cardboard definitions of evil oh yeah george kennedy is here too and when is that not a good thing br br if you liked wrong turn then watch this to see where much of its' methodology came from
